<b> Experiment|     <b> Exploring RNA Secondary Structure Prediction using the Nussinov Algorithm

### About the Experiment 

RNA molecules fold into specific shapes that help them function in the cell. In this experiment, we use the Nussinov algorithm to predict the secondary structure of an RNA sequence. The algorithm finds the best way the bases can pair to form a stable structure, helping us understand how RNA folds.
